For this part of the assignment, youâ€™ll write a report on the performance of the deep learning model you created for Alphabet Soup.

The report should contain the following:

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:

*Data Preprocessing*

1.  What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
- The target variable is the 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' column from application_df
2.  What variable(s) are the features for your model?
- The feature variables are every other column from application_df --> this was defined by dropping the 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' column from the original dataframe
3.  What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
- Both 'EIN' and 'NAME' columns were dropped/removed, because they were neither targets nor features for the dataset.


*Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model*

1.  How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
- In the first attempt, i used 8 hidden_nodes_layer1 and 5 hidden_nodes_layer2 -- these were just random guesses from which to iterate upon in the second try.
2.  Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
- I was not able to achieve the 75% model accuracy target
3.  What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
- I added more layers, removed more columns, added additional hidden nodes, and switched up the activation functions associated with each layer in an attempt to achieve higher model accuracy. 

Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
